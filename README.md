Project Description:


I'm creating a confession webpage where users can share their stories anonymously. The homepage will welcome users and display rotating pictures. There will be buttons for navigation: Home, News, Contact, Login, and Sign Up. The News button will lead to a tech news page. Users can contact the founder via email for complaints.
Additionally, a map will show the imaginary location of our company using Google Map API. Users can sign up with their first name, last name, email, and password, or log in with their credentials. After logging in, users can view all confessions in a table, categorized and sorted as per their choice. They can also create new confessions, edit or delete their own, and log out. Clicking on a confession title will show the full story where other users can comment or like it.
